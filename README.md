# Sublime PyMdown
A plugin for sublime text that can convert/preview Markdown via [PyMdown](https://github.com/facelessuser/PyMdown) (a python tool that utilizes [Python Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/) and [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) to convert).  PyMdown can also batch convert/preview folders as well in Sublime's sidebar.  Also provides commands to strip out critic marks out of a markdown file.

This is a personal package that I have no intentions of releasing to wider audiences, but I do not restrict others from using it.  Behavior and commands may be in flux as this is still in development.
