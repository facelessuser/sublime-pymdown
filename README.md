Sublime PyMdown
===============
A plugin for sublime text that can convert/preview markdown via [PyMdown](https://github.com/facelessuser/PyMdown) (a python tool that utilizes [Python Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/) and [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) to convert).  PyMdown can also batch convert/preview folders as well in Sublime's sidebar.  Also provides commands to strip out critic marks out of a markdown file.

This is a personal package that I have no intentions of releasing to wider audiences, but I do not restrict others from using it.  Behavior and commands may be in flux as this is still in development.

# Recommended Commands
No commands are provided out of the box currently except for the batch convert commands for the sidebar.  Templates and styles are configured in the PyMdown binary's setting file.  This plugin simply threads calls to it, and in some cases reads it output to the clipboard or sublime view.
